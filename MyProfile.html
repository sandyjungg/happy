    i am a human being that was born on August 23rd, 1993. i was born in south corea (I spelled Korea as Corea because
    that is how it was originally spelled before Japan decided to put it behind its alphabetical order during its
    colonization in Corea). I was born as a female and still prefer the pronouns; she, her, and hers.
